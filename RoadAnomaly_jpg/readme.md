![](frames/animals06_sheep_roads_lambs.jpg)

This dataset contains images of unusual dangers which can be encountered by a vehicle on the road - animals, rocks, traffic cones and other obstacles.
Its purpose is testing autonomous driving perception algorithms in rare but safety-critical circumstances.

The dataset contains images with associated per-pixel labels.
The labeling has been performed with our [LabelGrab](github.com/cvlab-epfl/LabelGrab) tool. Most frames retain the editor's files and can be further edited; some are missing because the labeling was done at a different resolution and rescaled. 
If you need the editor files and instance labels for all frames, please [contact us](mailto:krzysztof.lis@epfl.ch).

For any additional information, please contact [Krzysztof Lis](mailto:krzysztof.lis@epfl.ch).

The images are provided for research purposes.
We do not own the images; the authors and sources are listed in `credits.txt`.

### Directory structure

`RoadAnomaly`
- `readme.md`
